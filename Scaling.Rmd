# Data scaling
Scaling is important for data analysis and exploration, Data without scaling can produce misleading result. Also scaling is beneficial for mathematics computation and machine learning.

## standardization
Standardization unify all the samples' mean and std to 0 and 1, so we could compare the distribution among the scaled samples.
```{r}
# we can use the scale from dplyr
library(dplyr)
library(openintro)
scale_df = duke_forest[, 2:5]
# what happen if we did not scale.
boxplot(scale_df)
# after scaling
scale_df %>% mutate_all(~(scale(.) %>% as.vector)) %>% boxplot() # apply scale() to every column
```

## Min Max scaling 
MINMAX scaling is good for svm, so don't hesistate to use it :)
```{r}
minmax <- function(x, na.rm = TRUE) {
    return((x- min(x)) /(max(x)-min(x)))
}
scale_df = duke_forest[, 2:5]
# what happen if we did not scale.
boxplot(scale_df)
scale_df %>% mutate_all(~(minmax(.) %>% as.vector)) %>% boxplot() # apply minmax() to every column
```
